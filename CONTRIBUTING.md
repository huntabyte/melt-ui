## Code of Conduct

Melt UI has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as its Code of
Conduct, and we expect project participants to adhere to it.

Please read [the full text](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and
will not be tolerated.

## Heuristics

[heuristic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)>) /ˌhjʊ(ə)ˈrɪstɪk/

> A technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow, or for
> finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find any exact solution

- Priority is the best User Experience
- Complexity should be introduced when it’s inevitable
- Code should be easy to reason about
- Code should be easy to delete
- Avoid abstracting too early
- Avoid thinking too far in the future

## Questions

If you have questions about Melt UI, be sure to check out the docs where we have several examples
and detailed API references that may help you solve your problem. You can also share your questions
on our Discord community (link on [README.md](/README.md)). We're happy to help!

## How to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the project. Code is just one possible means of contribution.

- **Feedback.** Tell us what we're doing well or where we can improve.
- **Support.** You can answer questions on Discord, or provide solutions for others in
  [open issues](https://github.com/melt-ui/melt-ui/issues).
- **Write.** If you come up with an interesting example, write about it. Post it to your blog and
  share it with us. We'd love to see what folks in the community build with Melt UI!
- **Report.** Create issues with bug reports so we can make Melt UI even better.

## Creating a new component builder?

The Builder API is fairly new in its conception. As such, there aren't strict conventions around it.

Under the hood, the "elements" that builder exposes are nothing more than objects. The trick is,
these objects contain an UUID that is used to identify them. This UUID is then used to get the
element via document.querySelector and pass events to it.

You'll see two methods commonly appearing inside builders. `elementDerived` and
`elementMultiDerived`. In general, elementDerived is to be used when only a single instance of an
element is expected to be used (e.g. `root`), while elementMultiDerived accepts multiple instances
of an element (e.g. Tabs `trigger`). You pass in a store to them, and a callback that accepts both
the store values, and an `attach` method for attaching event listeners. This callback must return an
object in `elementDerived` and a function in `elementMultiDerived`.

In case you don't need to use stores, you also have the `element` and `elementMulti` methods, which
are just wrappers around the derived methods that don't accept a store.

In some cases, you'll want to run an effect whenever an internal value changes. You have the
`effect` method for that.

In case of any doubts, you can always check the source code of existing builders, or reach out to us
on Discord. We're more than happy to help!

## Preparing a Pull Request

[Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
are always welcome, but before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to
discuss it with maintainers, or check if there is already an issue for it.

A good PR is small, focuses on a single feature or improvement, and clearly communicates the problem
it solves. Try not to include more than one issue in a single PR. It's much easier for us to review
multiple small pull requests than one that is large and unwieldy.

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

2. Clone the fork to your local machine and add upstream remote:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/melt-ui.git
cd melt-ui
git remote add upstream https://github.com/melt-ui/melt-ui.git
```

1. Synchronize your local `develop` branch with the upstream remote:

```sh
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
```

1. Install dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```sh
pnpm i
```

1. Create a new branch related to your PR:

```sh
git checkout -b fix/bug-being-fixed
```

6. Make changes, then commit and push to your forked repository:

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD
```

7. Go to [the repository](https://github.com/melt-ui/melt-ui) and
   [make a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

8. We will review your Pull Request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an
   explanation.

## Working locally

### Development

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm i

# start docs page and see examples in the browser
pnpm run dev
```

Make your changes and check that they resolve the problem with an example in the local docs. We also
suggest adding tests to support your change, and then run `pnpm run test` to make sure nothing is
broken.

Lastly, run `pnpm run lint` && `pnpm run check` to ensure that everything is in order before
submitting the pull request.
