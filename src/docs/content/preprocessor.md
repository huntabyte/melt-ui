title: Preprocessor
description: Simplifying the syntax of Melt UI using a custom preprocessor.
---

## What it does

We provide a custom preprocessor that aims to enhance the DX of Melt UI just a bit further. It
introduces a new HTML attribute, `melt`, that accepts our builders as values. This helps trim down
on the boilerplate just enough to keep the markup nice and tidy. The PP will then transform our
special attribute into the proper Svelte syntax.

## How it works

In the most simplest form, the PP will take the following code:

```svelte
<script>
	import { createCollapsible } from '@melt-ui/svelte'
	const { open, root, content, trigger } = createCollapsible()
</script>

<div melt={$root}>
	<button melt={$trigger}>{$open ? 'Close' : 'Open'}</button>
	<div melt={$content}>Obi-Wan says: Hello there!</div>
</div>
```

and transform it into this:

```svelte
<script>
	import { createCollapsible } from '@melt-ui/svelte'
	const { open, root, content, trigger } = createCollapsible()
</script>

<div {...$root} use:$root.action>
	<button {...$trigger} use:$trigger.action>{$open ? 'Close' : 'Open'}</button>
	<div {...$content} use:$content.action>Obi-Wan says: Hello there!</div>
</div>
```

It can handle more complex scenarios, such as a builder that is a call expression with dependencies:

```svelte
<script>
	import { createBuilder } from '@melt-ui/svelte'
	const { builder } = createBuilder()
</script>

{#each Array(100) as _, i}
	<!-- Just a normal call expression -->
	<div melt={$builder({ arg: i })} />
{/each}
```

## Caveats

There is 1 important caveat to note. Builders that expect arguments for their action are not
supported.

For example, the `checkboxItem` builder from `createDropdownMenu` expects the following:

```svelte
<script>
	import { createDropdownMenu } from '@melt-ui/svelte'

	const { checkboxItem } = createDropdownMenu()
</script>

<!-- Note that the action requires arguments here ðŸ‘‡ -->
<div {...$checkboxItem} use:checkboxItem={{ checked: true }} />
```

As of now, there's no _good_ way to simplify this without degrading the experience of the library
for users that choose to _not_ use the PP. So for now, we'll just have to stick with the above
syntax for these cases, which are rather infrequent.
