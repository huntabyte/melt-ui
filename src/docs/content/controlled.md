<Callout type="warning">

Controlled components are an optional advanced feature and should only be used when necessary. If
you're unsure if you _need_ to use controlled components, you probably don't.

## Controlled vs. Uncontrolled

There are various definitions for controlled/uncontrolled components, but in the context of MeltUI,
uncontrolled means that the state and stores of a component are created and managed by us.
Controlled means that the user (you) can create and manage the state and stores.

All components are uncontrolled by default, and in most cases, this is more than enough. However,
our goal is to provide as much flexibility as possible, so we offer a few ways to give you more
control over the state and behavior of the components.

## Controlled Usage

For the following examples, we'll use the `Dialog` builder, but the same concepts also apply to
other builders. Be sure to reference the API docs for your builder to see what controlled options
are available.

### Bring Your Own Store (BYOS)

By default, we provide an `open` store from the `Dialog` builder that will have its state updated
whenever a `trigger` or `close` element is clicked/key-downed.

If you wanted to define your own `open` store so that its state could be shared and updated by other
parts of your app, then we offer a way for you to supply your own.

It's as simple as passing your own `open` store to the `createDialog` builder.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { createDialog } from '@melt-ui/svelte'

	const customOpen = writable(false)

	const {
		elements: { trigger, overlay, content, title, description, close },
		actions: { portal }
	} = createDialog({
		open: customOpen
	})
</script>
```

Behind the scenes, we're using the custom `open` store you passed in instead of creating our own.
Your store will be updated as the `open` store normally would, but you'll be able to freely modify
its state outside of the builder.

A "change function" is called when the value of a `state` store would normally change. It receives
an object with `curr` and `next` properties, whose values are the current and next values of the
store.

The `next` value is what the store would have been set to by default if the change function wasn't
used. The `curr` value is the current value of the store.

Whatever is returned from the change function will be used as the new value of the store.

The snippet below shows an example of how the change function could be used to prevent the `open`
store from being set to `true` based on some arbitrary condition.

```svelte {6-12,18}
<script lang="ts">
	import { createDialog, type CreateDialogProps } from '@melt-ui/svelte'

	const someCondition = false

	const handleOpen: CreateDialogProps['onOpenChange'] = ({ curr, next }) => {
		if (!someCondition) {
			return curr
		}

		return next
	}

	const {
		elements: { trigger, overlay, content, title, description, close },
		actions: { portal }
	} = createDialog({
		onOpenChange: handleOpen
	})
</script>
```

Of course, this is a contrived example, but it nicely demonstrates the power of this feature.
